A complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using SQL for data extraction and transformation, followed by an insightful and visually interactive Power BI dashboard for business intelligence and decision-making.

🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes sales and return patterns from a retail superstore using structured SQL queries and dynamic Power BI visuals. The goal is to uncover hidden insights, customer behavior trends, and regional sales performance to aid data-driven business strategies.

Power BI – Dashboard creation and interactive visual storytelling

MS Excel – Pre-cleaning & export for dashboard import

🧮 SQL Techniques Applied
JOINs (Inner/Left) to relate Orders and Returns data

GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING clauses for aggregation and filtering

Subqueries for deriving KPIs like average order value, total return sales

Aggregation functions: SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), MAX()

Time-series breakdown using YEAR() and MONTH()

Categorization and segmentation using CASE WHEN

🔍 Insights & Observations
Technology is the highest revenue-generating category.

Phones and Chairs are the most returned sub-categories, despite being top sellers.

California leads in state-wise sales performance.

Return rates are highest for Same Day delivery — indicating buyer’s remorse or quick purchase decisions.

No strong correlation between high discounts and high returns — mid-level discounts (10–20%) saw slightly higher return rates.
